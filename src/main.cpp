// Chris Spring - 2017
// creates a module that can read sensor values and transmit them over uart

// should be able to turn modue oleds to red
// should be able to check and see if default address is open
// should be able to turn module leds to yellow
// should be able to respond to messages addressed to this unit
// should be able to turn module leds green and begin data indication routine
// should poll a given set of pins on a given frequency
// should transmit raw data from sensors out via I2C
// should listen over i2c for interrupts or configuration changes
// should flash leds red when i2c collisions occurr
// should provide led feedback of manipulations of inputs
